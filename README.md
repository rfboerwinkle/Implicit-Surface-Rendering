# Rendering Implicit Surfaces Defined by LaTeX Expressions

In mathematics, one of the hardest things to view is a 4 dimensional function. This project hopes to provide a streamlined and portable viewer for these functions. A rendering method using newton approximations was developed previously, but it lacked the capability to render arbitrary functions. This project developed an interface for the method, accepting both raw Python code and LaTeX expressions. The interface used minimal overhead, and because of the structure of renderings, the previous rendering times of minutes were reduced to fractions of a second. This could be optimized and rewritten in a language such as C++ to achieve faster results. The conversion from LaTeX to Python worked for non-ambiguous functions. If the renderer was rewritten, the converter could also be optimized for C++ instead of Python. The rationale behind the Python implementation is portability. This, in combination with an intuitive GUI and respectable FPS make it a useful tool for visualizing 4D functions.
